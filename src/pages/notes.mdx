When you use `parse` to create a `Cycle`, the full type is `Cycle (Maybe (Note event))`. We've already learned what `Cycle` is, so let's work downwards into the type.

- `Maybe` represents the presence or the absence of a note. In a note's absence, it is a rest, or `~`.
- `Note` is a single chunk of musical time. It is often populated by a sample, although it can also be populated by synths, as we'll see later on this page.
- `event` is an incoming event from the external environment. For the most common cases this will be `Unit` (aka nothing at all), but it can be any incoming event from a browser like a click or a MIDI event.
