The `s` function turns mini-notation into a structure called a _cycle_ on its happy path to becoming music.

In this section, we'll focus on how to manipulate the notes inside of cycles, before turning to working with whole cycles.

## The parse function

Mini-notation is turned into cycles using the `parse` function. As `s` is a highly-overloaded function it also accepts cycles. So the two syntaxes (syntaxi?) below are equivalent.

<Player player={usingParseMain} code={usingParse} />

When you use `parse` to create a `Cycle`, the full type is `Cycle (Maybe (Note event))`.

 Let's work our way from the inside of the type to the outside:

- `event` is an incoming event from the external environment. For the most common cases this will be `Unit` (aka nothing at all), but it can be any incoming event from a browser like a click or a MIDI event.
- `Note` is a single chunk of musical time. It is often populated by a sample, although it can also be populated by synths, as we'll see later on this page.
- `Maybe` represents the presence or the absence of a note. In a note's absence, it is a rest, or `~`.
- `Cycle` is a container of sequences, chords, and/or branches, as we saw in the [section on mini-notation](../mini-notation).

## The anatomy of a Note

The definition of `Note` can be found in [`WAGS.Lib.Tidal.Types`](https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-wags-lib/blob/main/src/WAGS/Lib/Tidal/Types.purs). With aliases resolved, it is:

```haskell
newtype Note event = Note
  { sampleFoT :: Either (UnsampledTimeIs event -> Sample) Sample
  , forwardFoT :: TimeIs event -> Boolean
  , tumultFoT ::
      TimeIs event -> Tumultuous D1 "output" (voice :: Unit)
  , rateFoT :: TimeIs event -> Number
  , bufferOffsetFoT :: TimeIs event -> Number
  , volumeFoT :: TimeIs event -> Number
  }
```

Notes can be modified in terms of:

- their sample via `sampleFoT`
- the offset of the sample's buffer via `bufferOffsetFoT`
- whether the sample is played forwards or backwards via `forwardFoT`
- the playback rate of the sample via `rateFoT`
- the volume via `volumeFoT`
- the effects chain via `tumultFoT`

The only other type of import before we start hacking away is `TimeIs event`.

```haskell
newtype TimeIs event = TimeIs
  { event :: { isFresh :: Boolean, value :: event }
  , externalControl :: ExternalControl
  , headroomInSeconds :: Number
  , clockTime :: Number
  , sampleTime :: Number
  , bigCycleTime :: Number
  , littleCycleTime :: Number
  , normalizedClockTime :: Number
  , normalizedSampleTime :: Number
  , normalizedBigCycleTime :: Number
  , normalizedLittleCycleTime :: Number
  , littleCycleDuration :: Number
  , bigCycleDuration :: Number
  , bufferDuration :: Number
  , entropy :: Number
  , initialEntropy :: Number
  }
```

The fields correspond to the following:

- `event` - The previous incoming event, and wheter it just happened or not.
- `externalControl` - A vector of 1000 floats that can be mapped to any external control parameter, like sliders or knobs. If you have more than 1000 sliders or knobs in your interface, you should probably simplify your interface.
- `headroomInSeconds` - How many seconds of projected headroom until the next render cycle. Only used in advanced cases.
- `clockTime` - Number of seconds since playback started.
- `sampleTime` - Number of seconds since _this_ sample started playing.
- `bigCycleTime` - Number of seconds that the cycle takes _including_ branches. In a cycle that lasts 2.0 seconds with 3 branches, this number would go between 0.0 and 6.0.
- `littleCycleTime` - Number of seconds that the cycle takes _excluding_ branches. In a cycle that lasts 2.0 seconds with 3 branches, this number would go between 0.0 and 2.0.
- `normalizedClockTime` - `clockTime` normalized between 0.0 (when playback starts) and 1.0 (the end of time immortal). Rounded to the nearest floating point number.
- `normalizedSampleTime` - `sampleTime` normalized between 0.0 (when a sample starts) and 1.0 (when it ends).
- `normalizedBigCycleTime` - `bigCycleTime` normalized between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `normalizedLittleCycleTime` - `littleCycleTime` normalized between 0.0 and 1.0.
- `bigCycleDuration` - Number of seconds that the cycle takes _including_ branches. In a cycle that lasts 2.0 seconds with 3 branches, this number would be 6.0.
- `littleCycleDuration` - Number of seconds that the cycle takes _excluding_ branches. In a cycle that lasts 2.0 seconds with 3 branches, this number would be 2.0.
- `bufferDuration` - The duration of the sample in seconds.
- `entropy` - A random float between 0 and 1 that changes _every_ time the rendering loop is called, which is around 60fps.
- `initialEntropy` - A random float that is generated _once_ at the start of a sample and held.

The newtype `UnsampledTimeIs event` is just like its cousin `TimeIs` but without any information about the sample, meaning it lacks `sampleTime`, `normalizedSampleTime` and `bufferDuration`.

In all of the examples below, we'll be using the `Functor` and `Traversable` instances of `Cycle`, which allow us to map/traverse over the cycle and drill down to each `Note`.

### Numeric functions of time

There are lots of ways to change volume and rate, but the two classics we'll see time and time again are lfos and piecewise functions.

#### LFO

The `WAGS.Lib.Learn.Oscillator` package comes with two LFO functions `lfo`, which creates an LFO using a sine wave, and `lfo'`, which uses any periodic function from `Number -> Number`. Both return a function of time from `Number -> Number`.

```haskell
lfo'
  :: (Number -> Number)
  -> { freq :: Number, amp :: Number, phase :: Number }
  -> Number
  -> Number

lfo
  :: { freq :: Number, amp :: Number, phase :: Number }
  -> Number
  -> Number
```

#### Piecewise functions

The `simplePiecewise` function from `WAGS.Lib.Piecewise` creates a piecewise function for a group of breakpoints.

```haskell
simplePiecewise
  :: Array (Number /\ Number) -> Number -> Number
```

Note that the piecewise function does _not_ loop - to do that, you should use the `%` (remainder) operator from the `Math` package.

```haskell
simplePiecewise [0.0 /\ 0.0, 1.0 /\ 1.0] 1.0
  == simplePiecewise [0.0 /\ 0.0, 1.0 /\ 1.0] (3.0 % 1.0)
```

Of course, nothing stops one from doing the old <b>LFO-Piecewise-combo</b>!

```haskell
lfo'
  ((_ % 1.0) >>>
    simplePiecewise
      [ 0.0 /\ 0.0
      , 0.1 /\ 1.0
      , 0.3 /\ 0.1
      , 1.0 /\ 0.0]
  )
  { freq: 2.0, amp: 0.5, phase: 0.5 }
```

(drops the üé§)

### Changing the playback rate

Let's change the playback rate of two samples. We'll use a shorter syntax via `changeRate` and a longer one using traversals and lenses, which are equivalent. I recommend using the shorter syntax, as it is easier to read more resilient to version changes.

<Player player={playbackRateMain} code={playbackRate} />

No üêë were harmed in the making of that snippet.

### Changing the volume

Let's modulate the volume in the same fashion, using the shorter `changeVolume` and its equivalent expansion.

<Player player={volumeMain} code={volume} />

### Changing the buffer offset

Let's change the buffer offset in the same fashion, using the shorter `changeBufferOffset` and its equivalent expansion. As a reminder, the buffer offset indicates how many seconds into the sample the buffer starts playback.

<Player player={bufferOffsetMain} code={bufferOffset} />

### Changing the playback direction

Let's change the buffer playback direction in the same fashion, using the shorter `changeForward` and its equivalent expansion.

<Player player={forwardMain} code={forward} />

### Changing the effects chain

Effects chains are an advanced feature of wags and there will be [a whole section devoted to them](../fx) later in the documentation. That said, as they're part of the notes API, we'll visit briefly how to add one, using the shorter `changeEffect` and its equivalent expansion.

<Player player={effectMain} code={effect} />

### Changing the sample

Changing the sample only makes sense if there is something that makes it impossible to specify when creating a cycle, ie entropy. We'll use `changeSampleF` and its equivalent expansion.

<Player player={sampleMain} code={sample} />

## Synthetic notes

It's possible to create synthetic notes using arbitrary effect chains. Here we define a simple synthesizer and a more complex one with a full expansion. In the more complex example, we use `makePiecewise` to make an ADSR envelope.

`makePiecewise` returns an `AudioParameter` instead of a `Number`, so if you're working with `Number`-s, make sure to convert them to `AudioParameter`-s using `pure` before trying to combine them with another audio parameter (i.e. `myParam * pure 5.0` instead of `myParam * 5.0`).

<Player player={synthMain} code={synth} />

## Tagging notes

Instead of using map to apply a change to every note, we can tag individual notes or groups of notes and only apply the changes to the tags. Multiple notes can have the same tag to create novel groupings.

<Player player={tagMain} code={tag} />

## Cycles

If operations on notes allow us to produce fine-grained effects, operations on cycles allow us to construct (and deconstruct!) novel forms. Let's see how in the next section

<Nav next ={"../cycles"} nextT={"Cycles"} prev ={"../mini-notation"} prevT={"Mini-notation"} />
