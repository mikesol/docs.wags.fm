Mini-notation is a brand of notation invented by the fine folks at Tidal Cycles. Inspired by the work of Bernard Bell, it condenses pattern-based music into a very small vocabulary.  The `wags` mini-notation is less complete than the [Tidal cycles mini-notation](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation/), but it has the essential elements to get you started.

As an opening salvo, here's some mini-notation.

<Player player={openingSalvoMain} code={openingSalvo} />

By the end of this page, you'll be able creating mini-notation like a highly-skilled amateur!
