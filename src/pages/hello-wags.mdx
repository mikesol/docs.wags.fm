Wags is a PureScript library for working with music and sound in the browser. This [documentation](../) starts by introducing wags through the [tidal API](../hello-tidal), a front-end for wags that helps write pattern-based music using a syntax similar to that of [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org).

This part of the documentation dives into wags's low-level API. In addition to powering the tidal frontend, this API allows for the creation of [rich, interactive and performant browser-based musical applications and works](https://whatis.wags.fm), including integrations with  animation libraries like `purescript-painting`, `d3` and `three.js`. Like this instrument!

Here are some considerations to take into account when deciding between wags and its tidal front end. If the answer is yes, you probably want to use wags:

- Do I need to customize the interactivity of my web app?
- Does my web app use MIDI?
- Does my web app need to integrate into a JS framework like `reveal.js` or `React`?
- Am I going to use animations?
- Am I pulling in data to power my app from API calls or from an ML framework like `tensorflow.js`?
- Will I need fine-grained control over performance?
- Will my application use more than 1,000 web audio nodes at any single time?

The next section will look at the anatomy of a wags application, starting from the construction of a graph and going all the way up to embedding wags in an HTML document.
