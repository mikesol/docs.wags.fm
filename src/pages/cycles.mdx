Cycles are containers of notes and rests. Let's see what sorts of neat things operations you can perform on cycles.

## Instances

`Cycle` comes fully-loaded with instances of some useful typeclasses. The most useful ones are indicated below.

### Functor

### Apply

### Applicative

### Monad

### Traversable

## Utility functions

There are also several utility functions one can use to manipualte a cycle.

### reverse

### flatten

## Cycle constructors

In addition to parse, which turns a string into a cycle of notes, you can construct cycles using one of three utility functions.

## Tidal compat

`purescript-wags-lib` has a tida compat library, `WAGS.Lib.Tidal.Compat`, that aims to have API parity with the tidal cycles API. While the names of types and the typelcass overloading is different, the basic functionality is the same.  Here are examples of some functions from that API.

## Sequences

Working with cycles is useful for pattern-based music, but sometimes, we want an interface that's more like a DAW, where we work with sequences and sections of music. The next section will cover that.
