The `s` function turns mini-notation into a `Cycle` on its happy path to becoming music.

In this section, we'll focus on the `Cycle` type specifically, learning how to construct one programatically and what instances it has.

## The parse function

Cycles turn into cycles using the `parse` function. As `s` is a highly-overloaded function it also accepts cycles. So the two syntaxes (syntaxi?) below are equivalent.

## Instances

`Cycle` comes fully-loaded with instances of some useful typeclasses. The most useful ones are indicated below.

### Functor

### Apply

### Applicative

### Monad

### Traversable

## Utility functions

There are also several utility functions one can use to manipualte a cycle.

### reverse

### flatten

## Cycle constructors

In addition to parse, which turns a string into a cycle of notes, you can construct cycles using one of three utility functions.

## Notes

On the inside of cycles there are `Note`-s. In the next section, we'll learn how to apply transformations to notes.
