## Documentation

Wags is a text-based online DAW written in the [PureScript programming language](https://purescript.org).

The easiest way to use wags is through the tidal DSL, inspired by [Tidal cycles](https://tidalcycles.org). Wags also provides a low-level API that allows you to embed it into any site.
