This section will cover the basics of working with sequences using the wags tidal API. Sequences break the abstraction of tidal because they are no longer dealing with patterns, but rather treat music as streams of notes. Sequences are useful when you're working with a synthesizer, when you're mixing a track with multiple instruments, or when you're remixing a track.

Cycles and sequences exist on busses that are sent to a loudspeaker. Sometimes, it's useful to add effects to these busses like reverb, compression, or filters. The next section looks into the most common effects and provides links to a full API reference.
